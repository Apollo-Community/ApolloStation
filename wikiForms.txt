 [hr][br]
 [b]Golden rule:[/b] [center]Keep communications up at all times on the Security Channel and
 report all movements, arrests and all security matters over the radio.[/center][br]
 [hr][br]
 [b]Guidelines[/b][br]
 [*]Talk first, stun second.[br]
 [*]Always call for backup before attempting to confront a possibly dangerous criminal.[br]
 [*]Charge your weapons after every usage.[br]
 [*]Stay calm under all circumstances, anger and fear show weakness.[br]
 [*]Always lock Security lockers &amp; logout of security terminals after each use.[br]
 [*]Always label your designated locker with the hand labeller[br]
 [*]Seal off crime scenes and wait for forensics personnel to arrive. Do not touch anything in the crime scene.[br]
 [*]Avoid using force where possible.[br]
 [*]Inform the Warden when a criminal is wanted and set their wanted status via your security HUD if possible. Beepsky is a force to be reckoned with.[br]
 [*]Respect the chain of command! The Warden outranks you within the brig itself. Obey the Head of Security, but remember that the Captain outranks him.[br]
 [*]Remember your priorities: One punch is hardly something to arrest anyone over if there is a hostage situation.[br]
 [*]Always remember to do your paperwork! Keeping a track record of everything that has happened throughout the station is important.[br]
 [*]Remember: You cannot make a legal arrest without sufficient evidence of a crime. You are subject to arrest and demotion otherwise![br]
