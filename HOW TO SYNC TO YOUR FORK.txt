=========================== Upstream to Fork Sync through Git Shell ===========================
===============================================================================================

This is a small guide designed to help those that have forked stuicey/ApolloStation and have 
no idea how to sync commits made by others from stuicey/ApolloStation to your fork repo.
I had to search for a little while to find out how, so I made this simplified .txt file to help  
those that didn't know already. Yes, I'm looking at you, Gutsy.
------------

---Step 1---
This isn't too tricky, come on now:
------------

Open your GitHub desktop client
	If you recieved an error, just give up now.

---Step 2---
Time to open Git Shell through your forked Repository:
------------

Right click on your forked Repository -> Open in Git Shell
	We're doing it this way to ensure that we're updating your Fork, and not anything else.

---Step 3---
Type the following commands into the Git Shell, in order:
------------

git remote -v
	This will show you your current list of 'remotes'.

git remote add upstream http://github.com/stuicey/apollostation.git
	This adds a new remote named upstream that you can access easily in future should you 
	want to use Git Shell more often. It feels neaterer too.

git remote -v
	This will show you your new list of 'remotes'. Be sure to check that there's
	a new fetch and push for http://github.com/stuicey/apollostation.git named 'upstream'.
	
git fetch upstream
	Now, if you didn't get any errors then WELL DONE, YOU CAN PERFORM MENIAL TASKS! 
	We can move onto the actual sync now.
	If you did get an error then try this command again and Step 4, 
	however you should try replacing "upstream" with "stuicey".


---Step 4---
Now this is the fun part, type the following commands in order:
------------

git checkout master
	Just to make sure that we're sending commands for your fork, and not your
	pigeon dating simulator or whatever else you losers work on.

git merge upstream/master
	Now, if we did everything correctly then you should see all the commits that were
	fast-fowarded, and you can scroll up to check that you have everything.
	You SHOULD have something similar to: http://goo.gl/5iR8mC
	Commands on your Git Shell are always shown after "[master ... ]
	I have shown a basic error at this step for you to compare.
	If you got an error here, then just follow the instructions it gives you.


---Step 5---
Now you gotta save your work, just do the following:
------------

Go back to your GitHub client, you can close Git Shell now.

You should now have some unsynced commits. Go ahead and sift through them to make sure they're
all there, and they're the ones that you want.
	If there's something you don't want, just click on it, and then choose the option for
	"revert", this will undo the commit and leave it out of the sync.

Now the final step is to Sync it! 
	You'll find the button just under the Minimise, Maximise and Close window buttons.


Enjoy your updated code!
