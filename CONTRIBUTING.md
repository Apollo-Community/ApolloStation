Issues
------
Please search for your issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/Apollo-Community/ApolloStation/issues) before you submit a new one, so we can keep the amount of duplicate issues at a low level.
Also try to keep the conversations on-topic, so we don't flood the issues with unneeded spammy chats.

Once a developer has read your issue he will usually add some labels to it, in order to categorize them into smaller and related groups. For example:

- Bug: Actuall bug with the game's code.
- Mapping: An issue related to the maps and is fixed with the map editor.
- Missing assets: In game sprites, icons, sounds, maps etc.
- Suggestion: Any new feature request/new idea that needs discussion.
- Easy to fix: An issue with a theoretical easy fix, good for new coders looking to get started fixing bugs.
- Priority low/med/high/urgent: Ranks the issue on how important it is to get it fixed and how soon.
- It's a feature!: Issue is too good to not be an actual game feature!
