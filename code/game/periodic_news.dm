			 			to increase revenue, has refactored several of their facilities to perform experiments
			 			on live humans, including virology research, genetic manipulation, and \"feeding them

			the asteroid field gave results that may indicate the existence of new, promising phoron structures. While Curious Commoner
			investiagors were turned away by construction site security, few companies have described an interest in working asteroids like
