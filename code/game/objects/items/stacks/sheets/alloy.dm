/* Alloys
 * Alloys have different properties depending on their composition
 * The "strength" of these properties depends on the metal/glass:mineral ratio, as well as the mineral
 * A 50/50 ratio gives full strength properties
 *
 * Mineral sheets have a list of effects. This is a list of all used effects. Most are multipliers
 * These multipliers are only used in full in a 50:50 alloy. So a mineral with str = 3 in a 30:80 alloy would give a multiplier of 2.25, not 3.
 * 		rot - determines chance of wallrot appearing. 1 gives full immunity. UNUSED so far
 *		str - determines wall strength/damage cap, this is a multiplier for an ADDITION to the damage cap, not a multiplier to the damage cap itself. 0.5 = 50% higher cap
 *		blastarmor - determines resistance against explosions
 *		rad - how much radiation the alloy sends out
 *		tempres - determines maximum temperature
 *		acidres - 1 or 0, determines whether or not the alloy resists acid
 *		projarmor - damage reduction (or increase) from projectiles
